- **Average Consumption**: Overall average consumption (km/L).
- **Ranking**: Vehicle's position and average consumption within Spritmonitor rankings.
- **Next Service**: Upcoming service mileage, date, and note.
- **Estimates**: Estimated fuel level and remaining range.
- **New Insights**:
  - ðŸ”„ **Consumption Trend**: Improving / Worsening / Stable.
  - ðŸ“Š **Consumption Consistency**: How variable your fuel consumption is over time.
  - â›½ **Average Liters per Refueling**: Your typical refueling amount.
  - ðŸ“… **Average Days Between Refuels**: Refueling frequency.
  - ðŸ’° **Price Variability**: Difference between your highest and lowest price per liter.
  - ðŸŒ± **Eco Driving Index**: Efficiency score from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).
